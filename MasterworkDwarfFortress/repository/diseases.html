        <p>Dwarves have a chance to carry a diseases, or develope a new one. Some might only be carried into your fort by a migrant, others might spawn directly inside your fort. Dogs, Mastiffs and Badgerdogs have a chance to be infected with rabies, which can result in fights.</p>
        <p>You can isolate affected dwarves, migrants and dogs as you see fit, or try to combat the disease with a cure or medicine. You can brew medicine potions from 2 stacks of plants (any plant will do) in the Apothecary's Study. The elvish plant Cure-All, which can also be farmed in good biomes, has the same effect as medicine. Good biomes might cure the diseases automatically.</p>
        <p>Some diseases can infect other dwarves, others only a single one, other are transmited by fights. Take care. This feature is optional, and can be disabled in the GUI. under MiscSettings:Diseases. This required a new world gen.</p>

Grants hidden label: schizophrenic
<hr />
Liver cancer: affects 1% of dwarves - does not spread - permanent, liver necrosis can be prevented with cancer medicine - if untreated, liver will eventually undergo necrosis.

<hr />
<div align="center">
  <h1>Animal Diseases: </h1>
</div>
<hr />
<p>Rabies: initially affects 1% of dogs and mastiffs, can be given to animals only - permanent - affected animal goes berserk at 4 weeks, is labeled as &quot;rabid&quot; and starts spreading it by attack (1 victim/day); can spread it to intelligent creatures as well; victims go through a similar cycle and die at 5 weeks.
</p>
<hr />
<h1 align="center">How to handles diseases in a fort:
</h1>
<hr />
<p>- To avoid migrants bringing communicable diseases to your fort, the easiest way by far is to build migrant quarters where they and their animals can be quarantined for 1 month before they are let loose in your fort. However, note that if their race is affected by disease, merchants and invaders can bring epidemics to your fort too! Strategic merchant containment is also a possibility, and may even be safer for you for other reasons as well - if they die of pneumonia they caught from your dwarves, you will get the blame (but also the goods, so there's that).</p>
<p>- You can tell if an animal has rabies, because once it goes berserk, it and its corpse should be marked as &quot;rabid&quot;. If there is a rabies outbreak in your fort, don't feel too bad. It will have infected only a few other creatures unless you were really unlucky. Isolate everyone who was in contact with that animal, and observe them for 1 month. Some will die, but because rabies becomes contagious very slowly, there should be no further casualties.</p>
<p>- Epidemics are not as bad as you would expect, and spacious fortress design offers significant benefits now. Dwarves tend to be somewhat apart from each other and epidemics just sometimes die out and vanish without you doing anything if people aren't just chilling in a crowded dining hall. But in an overcrowded, small fort, well... you're going to have meningitis, pneumonia and flu bonanza. And vomit all over your hallways. However...</p>
<p>- Now that there are diseases, large and well-stocked hospitals are a thing. Hospitals should have plenty of medicine, wards where disease-bearing dwarves can be contained and observation chambers for dwarves who were in contact with a rabid animal. For epidemics, lock everyone in the infectious disease ward and feed them medicine until the epidemic has stopped. Unless you made wine lower blood pressure or are really good at micro, you'll also probably eventually have a collection of dwarves who had a stroke (but the chances of stroke are only 0,075% per month per dwarf, so not too many). Consider magma-based euthanasia unless you really love those dwarves. Important dwarves who you know have blood pressure could have their own chambers have stockpiles of blood pressure medication.</p>
<p>- The same goes for asylums. Schizophrenic dwarves should have their own little fort stocked with medicine so they can live relatively normal lives. However, since their occasional bonus creativity improves item quality, you may instead take the risks involved and let them live among your dwarves normally, preferably working as craftsdwarves - but they may eventually do something unwise. It's not particularly humane, but if you surround their craftsdwarf's workshop with cage traps, you'll most likely catch them if/when something goes wrong and can release them once they come back to their senses.</p>
<p>How does this affect fortress life?<br />
  - You might get migrants with a disease or a dwarf might develope a disease naturally. Some can only arrive from the outside, others, like psychosis or dementia, can develope inside your fort. You can treat the diseases by making medicine in the Apothecary. 2 stacks of random plants are mixed together to make 10 medicine potions. Any dwarf that drinks these will battle the disease much easier or be immune. For micromanagement reasons I only added this one medicine, which treats all diseases. Eating or drinking any food made of the elvish plant Cure-All will have the same effect. It can even be farmed in good biomes.</p><hr /></td>
