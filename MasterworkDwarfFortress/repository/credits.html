The great DF forum modding community allowed me the use   most of their raws to learn, find more ideas, or even whole parts of their mod.   Without it this mod would not be possible.</em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>I want to thank hugo_the_dwarf, rephikul, deon,   phoebus, narhiril, veok, bdog, quietust, warlord255, it 000, funk,   darkflagrance, d_e, zero, Ashnal, LucasNP, teh zip file, admiralawesome,   Seth_Creid, Naryar, Xangi, arclance, cc, san diego, UristDavinci and many many more. The   support in the forum was and is great. :)</em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>I also got a lot of feedback in the mod thread,   and even there the users helped by reporting inbalanced features, bugs and more.   Sometimes I came back to the forum, and found the correct fix already posted.   Thanks guys, you are awesome :)</em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>Special thanks again to hugo_the_dwarf   and rephikul  for the getting me started and deon, for the genesis mod, which started my interest in modding.</em> Zenerbufen for his Mac and Linux Support, Godlysockpuppet for his help on this manual, and Roses for the Sourcecode of the Python GUI<em>, as well as Arclance for his continued labors on linux and python.</em></p>

          <p align="center"><em>Smakemupagus also deserves a special mention, for his integrated Orc Fortress plugin.</em> Talvieno, for his random creature generation script, and the entire dfhack team for their amazing plugins that open new possibilities in modding. </p>
          <p align="center">New additions to these credits are: Ag, Falconne, Warmist, Expwnent, Kurik Amudnil, Boltgun, Putnam, Vjek<em>, Urist DaVinci and Peterix. All of which have helped with scriptes, either by coding themselves, fixing or helping on them. Many advanced features wouldnt be possible without dfhack. Insolor for his localization patcher, which allowed nice little eastereggs and new skills/labors.</em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>Everyone who worked on the wiki, especially Briess/Lokriani and Smake for getting it started, and Jimboo for proof-reading so much of my texts.
